# Ruby Anywhere

Over the last few years, Ruby has started working it's way into everything. If someone came up to me and asked me to program something for a platform I probably could. Need an application running on the JVM alongside all your Oracle stuff? Let's do it, rvm install jruby. You want an iOS application and OS X application that stay in sync? Great! I'll get the two RubyMotion projects going and use Sinatra to do the API. Android too? Domo Arigato, Mr. Ruboto. Windows Phone? Windows 8? Xbox too! Ruby forged with Iron! You are no match for my IronRuby blade! Microsoft come at me! Command line app... I got this... Get the point?

Between Ruby and Javascript, there is an astonishing growth in the number of places where it is acceptable to use languages that a decade ago weren't even widely understood, and the portability just keeps growing.

In this talk we will look at all the places Ruby has become and option, the tools at our disposal, places to learn about those tools, and take a look at some examples out there in the real world, and I will open your eyes to just how many different kinds of projects we can work on.

He has recently begun creating screencasts about his adventures with RubyMotion, and has found a small group of 20 subscribers together to help him get the screencasts focused on the important topics and on important "features" of the screencast, like every episode being done using behavior driven development.
